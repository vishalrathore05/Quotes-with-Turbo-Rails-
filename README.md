# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


* In this application, we will write Rails system tests to make sure our application always behaves as we want it to. Luckily, those tests are straightforward to write.

* IN the Appliction we add "" the autofocus option is here to focus the corresponding input field when the form appears on the screen, so we don't have to use the mouse and can type directly in it.
